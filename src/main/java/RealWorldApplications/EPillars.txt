10.2MYTHS ABOUT ECONOMY FOR UPSC PRELIMS
 (Batch:PCB13-RAFTAAR-ONLY-Prelims) Mrunal’s Economy Pillar#1A1 Money: Barter to Bitcoins → Page 4
I’m not making Memes for everything, otherwise pages will increase so just accept following:
 Myths Reality
 In Economy, ONLY concepts are important for UPSC. Both facts and concepts are asked.
if something is not asked in the last 3 years, then such topic
will never be asked.
 UPSC examiner asks trend
breaking questions.
if some economy topic is older than one year, then it is not
important. Only last one year current affairs is important.
 UPSC asked many Economy MCQs
from events older than one year.
 We've to read economic-times, business line, etc newspapers. NOT required.
 10.3  PYQ A 🏛💳 NALYSIS: INCREASED DIVERSITY IN ECONOMY TOPICS IN PRELIMS
 • From table given below, you can see that the diversity and variety of economy MCQs
questions has increased/changed in recent Prelims, so it is inevitable that handouts will get
lengthy.  जब प्रश्नों की वि वि धता और जटि लता बढ़ रही ही ता ये लजमी ही टिकी ज्यादा नो स लम्बे बनोनो पड़ेंगे.
• So, please do not be fooled by the "negative-PR toolkit" circulated by Delhi-offline coaching
mafia against my notes via timepass vloggers and bikaau-royal-entry toppers.
 • Black background cell = NOTHING asked from said topic in that year.

�Economy Pillar #1-A1) Money: Barter to Bitcoin
 10.4🍅🌽  BARTER SYSTEM & ITS DISADVANTAGES: (वस्तु विववि मय प्रणाली)
 Barter system was introduced by Mesopotamian tribes. It has following challenges: (चुनोविताये )- 😰Double co-incidence of Wants (आश्यकीताओ की दाहीर सयेगे नोही हीगे ता व्यापर असभ).- 😰Search Cost & Transaction cost is high.  (सही दामी पर चुज ढूँढूँनो  लनोदानो की लगेता बढ़ जता ही)- 😰Storage of perishable commodities is difficult, results in loss of value.  (नोश नो स्तुओ की मील्यहीस)- 😰Doesn’t encourage specialization and division of labour (श्रमी वि भजनो की प्रत्साटिहीता नोही कीरता).

(unlike AmazonPay / Mobikwick etc)
 Such app can have Push transaction (e.g. Remittance to family),  Pull Transaction (e.g. monthly
bill deduction by Electricity Co.) or even Bill sharing among friends.
 Examples of UPI based app: SBI’s SBIBuddy/Yono, Axis Bank’s AxisPay and NPCi’s BHIM.
 UPI 2.0 (2018): Upgraded version of UPI. What are its new features? How is it different than UPI

10.12.5 🛍️ UPI-Lite (on-device wallet)
 User adds money from his bank account to his UPI Lite wallet on his mobile App. (e.g. Google Pay
App, BHIM App)
 🤩 Benefits of UPI-Lite wallet?--
 🤩 Faster. Because No need to provide UPI-PIN number during transaction.
 🤩 Less chances of transaction failure- even if sender’s bank server is facing technical issues.

 10.13 🔪PRE-SANCTIONED CREDIT LINE
 When a banker allows an account holder to borrow upto a predetermined amount of money, without
having to apply for a loan, it is called Pre-Sanctioned Credit Line. (इसकी टिहीदा कीरनो की मीतालब नोही ही. मीख्या परक्षा मी
इस प्रकीर की चुज नोही पछाता)
 10.13.1 🔪🛍️ UPI: Pre-sanctioned credit line/Overdraft in UPI (2023-Apr)--
 RBI allowed Pre-Sanctioned Credit Line / overdraft facility extended to UPI.
So, even if a person does not have balance in his bank account, still he can PAY using UPI while
shopping. (and then later, when he gets the salary/pension/income deposited in his bank
account, then the banker will recover the principal and interest.)
 10.13.2 🔪 🛍️UPI: Benefits of UPI-overdraft facility= BNPL--
 Help customers in “Buy now pay later (BNPL)” format of shopping. (Ref: Pillar#1B1 for more)
 Poor people require small small amount of money/loans during last weeks of a month. They
cannot travel to the city’s bank branch for the paperwork and banker may take many days to pass
application. Consequently, poor villagers borrow from the local moneylender/Shroff/Baniya at
high interest rate. UPI-Overdraft can help overcoming this to some extend. = helps in Financial
inclusion of the poor. (गेरब की वि त्तये समी शनो मी मीदादा)

 Over the years, following facilities/technology has been developed by NPCi
 • scan QR code➡️  transfer money from bank account via UPI ➡️ to get coins from machine
 • deposit cash in Cash Deposit Machines (CDMs) by logging into your bank account via UPI
(no need to insert debit card in the machine)
 • withdraw cash from ATM machine  by logging into your bank account via UPI (no need to

 10.13.5 🕵🏻 🤳NPCI  → UPI  BHIM Full form: Bharat Interface for Money (2016)
  Money transfer app designed by NPCi. It works on Android, iOS/Apple mobiles as an APP,
 Works even on non-smart (=basic feature) phones using *99# USSD- Unstructured
Supplementary Service Data.
  Bank to bank / peer to peer transaction using mobile phone (xyz@upi). No need to install
multiple apps for each bank account (SBIBuddy, AxisPay etc) just one BHIM app to use all such
bank accounts.
 (1) App has 3 factor authentication system- as per Indianexpress (2) App has 2 factor
authentication system as per NPCi website. (
 🚩👶🏻
 FAQ: then which fact is true? Ans. i'd go for
official website.)
  Your money stays in bank account and earns interest. It’s not stored in ‘wallet outside your bank
account’ as it happens in Mobikwick, Phonepe etc. (PS: in later stage, PhonePe etc private apps
also included UPI type mechanism so storing money in ‘wallet’ became optional but we need not
engage in Hairsplittery/PHD.)
  No cards involved so no MDR or such hidden charges.
 🔠❓ MCQ. Find Correct Statement(s) [ Prelims-2018]
 1. BHIM app allows the user to transfer money to anyone with a UPI-enabled bank account.

China’s Union Pay. Rupay charges less fees than other companies.
  Works in 3 channels: 1) ATM, 2) Point of Sale Device (PoS/card reader machine), 3) Online
portals.
 Rupay debit card given free with  PMJDY (Jan Dhan) Bank account (Refer Pill#1D).
  Rupay has signed collaboration agreements with some digital payments companies in Singapore,
Japan etc. So, it may be used in those countries. But presently Rupay is not having the widest
reach across all the countries unlike MasterCard and Visa.

Presently both NACH and ABPS methods used for giving salaries to MGNREGA workers. Thus,
it’s called Mixed payment mode/hybrid mode for MGNREGA wages.--
Government wants to shift completely to ABPS method. But due to operational and technical
issues, deadline keeps getting delayed.
Some poor people (without Aadhar card) given exemption from ABPS.
Opposition party alleged that government is "weaponizing the technology"  to deny money to
poor people without Aadhar card.

bank levies interest rate.
 Debit card can be used to withdraw ₹ ₹ from
ATM from your existing bank balance.
So, it’s not ‘borrowing’.
 Credit card vs Overdraft?
 1. Credit cards = for shopping. You carry card
in your pocket. Bank may give u some
reward-points/gifts if you spend “₹.X” per

  This ensures your card information is not disclosed to merchant website= protection from
hacking. Card owner can generate Tokenization through visiting card-issuer’s/banker’s
website/App through laptops, desktops, tablet, wearables (smartwatch) etc.
  From 1/10/2022, this became effective.

 10.18💳 MDR: FULL FORM: MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE (व्यपैरिरकी छूट दार)
 In above photo, MDR fees % is not actual number but for illustration/example.
  MDR is the fees that a merchant must pay to his (acquirer) bank for every card transaction.
 MDR fees is shared among 3 parties 1) customer’s card issuing bank 2) merchant’s acquiring
bank 3) payment gateway provider. (तानो पक्षा मी इस फास की ब जता ही)
  MDR hurts merchants’ profit margin, discourages them from adopting Point of Sale (PoS)
terminals (=card swiping machine)  →  obstacle to digital economy.  (व्यापर की मीनोफा पर असर हीता ही

bankers promote MasterCard & Visacard to their customers and merchants (instead of
Rupay/UPI). (बकीर की मीज़ी नोही आता क्योटिकी उस डोविब कीडो  येपआई एप मी MDR की फ़स नोटिही गिमीलगे।)

 FAQ: How can NPCi give license? it is not a statutory body unlike RBI.
 Ans. Don’t mix the word ‘license’ with sarkaari type licenses (Gun /vehicle/bank etc.) Here, the word
'license' is in context of getting permission from a company. Example, If you want to use Photoshop
software, you have to “buy” license-key from Adobe company.
 10.22🕵️ ♂️  💳 DIGITAL PAYMENT REGULATORY BODIES (वि यत्रणा स्थाए)
 10.22.1 🕵️ ♂️  💳 Digital Transactions Ombudsman (DTO-2019 / लीकीप्रहीर)

 Settlement finality
  “settlement finality” = there is no risk of reversal or cancellation after the financial transaction is
complete. e.g. Cash or CBDC-e₹. (एकी बर भगेतानो कीर टिदाये ता टिफार समीनो प की पस पस गेये।  उसकी उल नोही सकीता।)
  Whereas, if a payment is made via Credit card/ cheque-book
→
 customers can later block the
payment by contacting the banker within a time-limit. So they (creditcard / cheque) do not have
instant-settlement finality. (उधर आप बकी मी शिशकीयेता कीर की भगेतानो की रकी सकीता ही।)
 10.27.7
  🙋🏼‍♀️FAQ: can we say that as mode of payment (UPI/Debit Card/NEFT-RTGS) also has
settlement finality? Ans. I copied only that much which is given in Newspaper/Press-release. I
did not become Sherlock Holmes to do find further info/PhD. Feel free to delay your syllabus
completion by asking ChatGPT.

 • (e₹) stored in a separate digital wallet/separate mobile created by the bankers.
 • (e₹) does not earn savings interest rate, unlike normal bank deposits (because you are
keeping it with yourself in a digital wallet. So bankers do not treat it as a deposit).
 • (e₹) can be converted to other forms of money, like deposits with banks. But then you will
have to move that money out of your digital wallet

 🐯🔗💮= 👌🥰Benefits of CBDC (कीद्राय की ड़िर्डभिर्जटली मद्रा की फॉयदा)
 CBDC/ Sovereign Digital Fiat Money / Digital Base Money will provide following benefit
 1. ↓  Cost printing and transporting physical currency. (नो छापनो की लगेता और परिर हीनो खोचु मी कीमी)
 2. ↓  Scope for counterfeiting. (जल नो बनोनो मीब्सि ल)
3. ↑ Traceability, ↓Anonymity: (ढूँढूँनो आसनो, गेमीनोमी/अज्ञाता रहीनो मीब्सि ल)
 a. Whether money is reaching the intended beneficiary or not?  (लभथे की येजनो की पस गिमील

 b. From where did the businessman accumulate this money, did he pay an appropriate
amount of tax or not? Else auto-alert to the Income tax department for tax evasion.
(कीरचुर पर विनोगेरनो आसनो)
 4. Possible to develop programmable currency. E.g. govt transferring ₹6000 in poor farmer’s
account with condition ke it must be spent WITHIN next 15 days for buying seeds/farming tools
ONLY.
 5. Global money transfer more easier. E.g. in future China may give DIGITAL YUAN currency
LOANS directly to Ghana Without converting into US Dollars and without using SWIFT
messaging system.
+ many other things but they are more relevant for Mains rather than Prelims.

 10.28.1 (e₹): Fungibility of CBDC 💮
 Doubt: if we program the CBDC currency for specific use - example only for purchasing of books, then
it is no longer fungible! Because we cannot use it for any other purpose e.g. buying Pizza!!
In that case, as soon as the book is purchased, the money goes to the bookshop owner  money →
 again becomes fungible. Because the bookshop owner can use the money for any purpose
 If the student doesn’t buy the book,  CBDC-money goes back to the school, and fungibility is →
 restored (because the school admin can use it for any other purpose).
 (Batch:PCB13-RAFTAAR-ONLY-Prelims) Mrunal’s Economy Pillar#1A1 Money: Barter to Bitcoins → Page 50
“Thus, programmability does not violate/destroy fungibility (of Rupee), it is only a specific use
binding.”- said RBI Governor. (र्भूली की शॉ-प्र मिमग  CBDC ऐ सि मिम कीर दिदाय र्जए, की कीछू ही चर्ज उ खरदा की

 10.28.2 💠 Non-fungible token (NFT: ग़र-फ़ंर्ज ली टकी)
  (Definition) NFT is a Digital file, photo file (JPEG), Animated image (GIF), music file (MP3) etc
Stored using blockchain Technology. ब्लॉकीचुनो प्रद्यगिगेकी द्वार सग्रटिहीता फ़ , सगेता इत्याटिदा की टिडोजिजल फाइल ही।

physical-painting etc. (भविताकी सम्पचित्तये की मीलिलकी दास्तुज की भ टिडोजिजलकीरण कीर एनोएफ़ मी सग्रटिहीता कीर सकीता ही)
  NFT cannot be subdivided. Their individual sub-units cannot be exchanged with one another.
Because their values are different based on buyer’s preference. So NFTs are non-fungible. (अलगे
